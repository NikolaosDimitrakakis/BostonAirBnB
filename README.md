## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Boston AirBnB data from 2017 to understand:

1. Who host has the more listings in Boston and their price?
2. To take a brief look at response time, response rate and acceptance rate of the hosts.
3. How location affecting price? 
4. The price is related to room type?
5. How the bed type is connected to price? 
6. Can we predict the price?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here with work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb Inside for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
